            <h1>Hi, I am Ben Horler!</h1>
            <h3>I am studying NCFE Level 2 Principles of Cyber Security at Petroc college.</h3>
            <p>This academic year I have learnt many new skills. I have taken a deep dive into the Principles
            of secure software design, reviewed the threat landscape, and understood how organisations need 
            to keep themselves secure.</p>
            <p>I have also learnt how to write code, studying Python, HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JS. These languages
            should enable me to progress to Level 3 Digital Production, Design and Development bringing me closer to my goal of becoming a </b>software developer</b>.</p>
            <p>I live in North Devon but I only live here because my mum wanted to be closer to a beach. Me. A gamer. Going to the beach. She's crazy. My hobbies include gaming and... Nothing else, just gaming. </p>
            <p>My favourite food is noodles but I also will accept pizza. My favourite snack food is crisps although I love Tony's Chocolonely. (I mean who doesn't!) </p>
